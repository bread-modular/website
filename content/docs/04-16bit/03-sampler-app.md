summary: Learn about the 12-voice drum sampler app with three effects.
---

This is a 12-voice drum sampler with three effects slots. It divides samples into two groups (A & B), and you can assign separate effects for both groups. 

There is also an additional filter with lowpass and highpass controls assigned only to group A.

These 12 voices are attached to keys in an octave. You can play them by sending MIDI notes of the related key regardless of the octave.

## Features

With the 16bit UI, you can:

- Change samples
