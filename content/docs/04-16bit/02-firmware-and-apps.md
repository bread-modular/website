16bit comes with a firmware that includes a bunch of apps loaded into it. Think of an app as a mini-firmware that you can load using the [web UI](/ui/16bit) with a click.

## Using the Firmware

1. First, plug 16bit into the Bread Modular base. Make sure you've powered it on.
2. Then connect 16bit to your computer (PC or Mac) using the USB-C socket on top. (You may also use any Android device, but you can't use any iOS device)
3. Visit the following web app: <https://breadmodular/ui/16bit>
4. Click the connect button and select your 16bit device (usually named as 16bit)
5. Now you can select an app or configure the loaded app.
