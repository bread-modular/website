Although you can load apps using the web UI, each of these apps is bundled into the firmware. As we release new features and apps, you need to update the firmware. It's very easy:

1. Plug your 16bit into a computer using the USB-C cable.
2. Visit the 16bit UI. If there's an update, you will see a banner on top of the screen. If so, click it and download the firmware.
3. Additionally, you can directly [visit here](/modules/16bit#firmware) and download the latest firmware.
4. Press the BOOT button and hold it. Then press the RESET button and release both at once.
5. Now you will see a drive mounted on your computer.
6. Simply paste the downloaded firmware into it.
7. Once copying is finished, it will automatically reload the firmware.
