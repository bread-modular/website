summary: Learn about the 9-voice polyphonic synth with Moog-like ladder filter and envelope controls.
---

This is a 9-voice polyphonic synth with a Moog-like ladder filter attached. By default, it uses sawtooth oscillators, but you can change this using the 16bit UI.

The amp envelope's attack and release can be controlled using the CV1 and CV2 knobs of the 16bit module.

## Filter Controls

To access the filter, you need to use the MCC module and select bank A. Here are the parameters:

1. **Envelope** - Increase both attack/release at the same time
2. **Mod Depth** - How deep the envelope should affect the cutoff frequency 
3. **Resonance** - Controls the resonance of the filter
4. **Lowpass Cutoff** - Increasing will reduce the cutoff frequency and close the filter
