title: Common Parts
summary: Some of the parts you'll need when assembling a Bread Modular module.
---

The majority of electronic components used in Bread Modular modules are SMT components, reducing the need to source a wide variety of parts. However, for input components and connectors, THT components are employed. Here's a guide on how to source them:

## Pin Headers (Male)

Standard 2.54mm spaced pin headers are used. Packs of 40-pin headers can be purchased from most electronics stores.
For enhanced durability and conductivity, opt for gold-plated pins whenever possible.

* [Recommended part on Ali Express](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005003642908658.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.35.48a51802o16Utk)

## Pin Header Sockets (Female)

These are sockets with 2.54mm spacing between pins. The ideal hole size of the socket should be 0.76mm. 

* [Ideal Component (Circular)](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/preci-dip/801-87-005-10-001101/3757433) - Perci Dip 801-87-005-10-001101
* [AE Modular Sockets (Circular)](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p123/10_x_PATCH_SOCKETS.html) - Sockets used in AE Modular
* [Standard 2.54mm Sockets (Square)](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-2.54-headers-sockets-female.html?spm=a2g0o.productlist.search.0) - You may choose 40-pin or 5-pin arrays.

## Potentiometers

We use a specialized type of potentiometer designed for direct soldering onto PCBs.

You can source these from the following suppliers:

> Depending on the module, select potentiometers with the appropriate resistance. Common values include 50K, 1M, 500K, and occasionally 10K or 1K.

* **Song Huei:** High-quality potentiometers (via [Thonk UK](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/ttpots/))
* **Standard RV09:** Available on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-Rv09.html?osf=direct)
* **Knobs:** Compatible knobs are [available from Thonk](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/tall-trimmer-toppers/)
* **AE Modular:** Good quality [knobs](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p112/10_x_KNOBS.html) and potentiometers

## Patch Cables

We use patch cables designed for breadboards to ensure ease of use and cost efficiency. Standard breadboard jumper cables may **not** always be ideal. Instead, consider the mating pin to be around 0.76mm.

* **Best Option:** [AE Modular Patch Cables](https://www.tangiblewaves.com/store/p74/Patchwires_Starter_Set_%2810%2C_17%2C_25%2C_40_cm%2C_6_of_each%29.html)
* **DuPont Wires - 22 AWG:** male-male cables on [AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-Dupont-2.54mm-Cable-22-awg-male.html?osf=direct)
* **DIY Patch Cables**: You can use [this crimp pin](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/norcomp-inc/180-001-170L001/858218) of 0.76mm diameter to make patch cables by yourself.

## Vactrols

Vactrols are occasionally used as voltage-controlled resistors in electronic designs. These components are not widely available in electronic stores. The following sources are recommended:

* **VTL5C3:** Available at [Synthrotek](https://store.synthrotek.com/VTL5C3-Vactrol-Optocoupler_p_792.html) (fast shipping)
* **VTL5C3 (AliExpress):** Same as above, but [cheaper](https://www.aliexpress.com/w/wholesale-vtl5c3.html?osf=auto_suggest)
* **Xvive Vactrols:** Difficult to source and often expensive

## 3.5mm Stereo Sockets

We use a special type of 3.5mm Stereo Socket that can be soldered directly onto a PCB. It's known as PJ366ST (usually comes in green). You can source them from the following places:

* [Thonk UK](https://www.thonk.co.uk/shop/thonkiconn/)
* [Synthrotek](https://store.synthrotek.com/35mm-Stereo-PCB-Mount-Jacks_p_761.html)
* [Bulk Order via AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005004248247782.html?spm=a2g0o.order_list.order_list_main.152.11b41802yIvLf6)
