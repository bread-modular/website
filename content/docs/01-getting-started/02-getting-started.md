title: Getting Started Guide
summary: Here's how you can get started with Bread Modular.
---

Since we are Open Source, you can get started with Bread Modular in a couple of different ways. Let us walk you through those:

## 1. Get the Starter Kit

You can [buy](/modules/starter-kit) the Starter Kit with all the essential modules. Once you get the kit, it's just about patching & making sounds.

If you want to extend your system, you can follow the steps below:

## 2. Order Individually

If you know exactly what you are looking for, you can [order](/modules) individual modules & build your Bread Modular system. We highly recommend you include the [base](/modules/base) module. 

## 3. Assemble Yourself

If you are comfortable with soldering & sourcing general electronic parts, this is the way to go. You can buy PCBs with assembled SMT components from our [store](/modules).

### Difference between semi-assembled & fully assembled

* Fully assembled modules come with everything; you can plug them into the base & start patching.
* Semi-assembled modules come with pre-assembled SMT components, but you need to solder potentiometers, sockets & pin headers.

Then you can source [additional parts](/docs/technical-details/common-parts) as listed in the docs. For example, these are the external parts you need to source for the [hihat](/modules/hihat#external-parts) module.

## 4. Build from Scratch

If you are quite comfortable with basic electronics, we encourage you to build modules from scratch. You can either use our published Gerber files to fabricate and assemble modules or build a new module from scratch. 

We have a [separate guide](/docs/getting-started/build-it-yourself) on how to build from scratch; you will find all the information you need.
