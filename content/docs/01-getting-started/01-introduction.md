summary: Learn about Bread Modular's philosophy and how to get started with modular synthesis.

Bread Modular is an affordable modular synth platform built around the following core principles:

1. Minimalistic Design
2. Open Source Everything
3. Modern Capabilities

Let's expand:

## Minimalistic Design

We make it affordable by making things minimal rather than cutting corners on electronics & parts. For example:

* Our modules are just a PCB
* All the components including knobs & sockets are soldered into it
* We use a common ground, so we can use single-wire data communication


## Open Source Everything

We [develop](/develop) in the open. You can access everything we do from [our GitHub](https://github.com/bread-modular/bread-modular). We share all the schematics, PCB designs & code.

We even show you how to use [PCB manufacturing services to assemble PCBs](https://youtu.be/eTam3B5scmY?si=M_9DaomW9O6EwgJN) as well as [sourcing parts](/docs/common_parts).

In contrast to other projects, we use the permissive **MIT license**. So, you are free to do whatever you wish & you don't need to share your derived work. (But we appreciate it if you do.)

## Modern Capabilities

We use proven analog designs but incorporate modern electronics to add more features & reduce costs. Here are some points:

* We use MIDI as a communication method across modules, which allows us to do more while reducing the wiring between modules.
* We use USB-C as a power supply, so you can power Bread Modular almost anywhere.
* We use SMT components & modern microcontrollers like the ATtiny 1616 to do more while being small & cost-effective.
