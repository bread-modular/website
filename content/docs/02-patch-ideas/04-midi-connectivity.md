title: MIDI Connectivity
summary: Connect MIDI devices to Bread Modular and make sounds.
---

Most of the modules in Bread Modular accept MIDI and allow you to control the modules via MIDI. In this patch, we show you how to connect your MIDI device to Bread Modular. You can connect any device that supports MIDI DIN or TRS connectivity.

Then we show you how to feed that MIDI data into our [MCO](/modules/mco) module along with the [LOW](/modules/low) pass gate modules to make some sounds.
