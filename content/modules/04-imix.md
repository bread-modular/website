This is a 4 channel analog mixer meant for mixing audio signals. 

> You can use this to MIX CV signals, but since this mixer uses 1.65V as the virtual ground, the end result will be different.

## Inputs

1. Channel 1 Audio Input
2. Channel 2 Audio Input
3. Channel 3 Audio Input
4. Channel 4 Audio Input

## Outputs

A mix of all the channels.

## Functionality

This can be used as a final mixer or as a submix. This module uses rail-to-rail opamps. So, even though we work with a 3.3V setup, it has capable headroom.
