This is a 4 channel analog mixer meant for mixing audio signals. 

> You can use this to MIX CV signals, but since this mixer uses 1.65V as the virtual ground, the end result will be different.

## Functionality

This can be used as a final mixer or as a submix. This module uses rail-to-rail opamps. So, even though we work with a 3.3V setup, it has capable headroom.
