This is a stereo headphone output module. It can drive any DJ or studio headphones.

> This is the same headphone output available in the [BASE](/modules/base) module, but as a separate module.

## Functionality

* Separate volume controls for each channel.
* If the "R" channel input is not provided, the "L" channel input will be normalized to the right channel.
* High impedance headphones can be used, but won't reach the maximum volume.
