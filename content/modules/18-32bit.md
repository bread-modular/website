## Controls

* **CV1**: Attenuates the CV1 input when provided; otherwise, the CV1 input is normalized to 3.3V
* **CV2**: Attenuates the CV2 input when provided; otherwise, the CV2 input is normalized to 3.3V
* **MODE**: Customizable button with LED indicator

## Additional Parts

> This section is only relevant if you are purchasing the semi-assembled module. You must source and solder the following parts. Check our guide on [common parts](/docs/technical-details/common-parts) for sourcing these components.

* 2.54mm Header Pins (5-pin) - 2
* Circular Pin Header Sockets (5-pin) - 2
* 50k Potentiometers - 2 (for CV1 & CV2)

## Firmware

You can download and install firmware for the 32bit using the [32bit UI](/ui/32bit/). The 32bit firmware supports multiple apps including FX Rack, which can be selected and installed through the web interface.
