The Electronics Lab Kit is a configuration of Bread Modular where you can experiment with Audio Electronics and build things faster. This is the same setup we used to build most of our modules.

## What's Included

* Well-detailed set of [tutorials on audio electronics](https://breadmodular.notion.site)
* USB-C Power
* Line In/Out
* Headphone Out
* Potentiometers
* 3.5mm Jacks
* [16bit](/modules/16bit) Elab (Oscilloscope, Waveform/Pulse Generators)
* [Envelope Generator](/modules/env)
* An integrated Bread Board
* A bunch of electronic components (Opamps, resistors, caps, etc)

> Using this setup, you can re-create all the analog modules in Bread Modular.

## 16bit ELab

This is an adaptation of our 16bit module as a modern electronic bench tool. You can connect it to your computer using USB-C and now you have a very powerful web-based oscilloscope:

> This is a [web-based tool](https://breadmodular.notion.site/Course-Content-Part-1-2387117770b8806b82addf4716c11a6e?pvs=25#2387117770b8803c8d6fd13f46797be0) and no additional software is needed. Also, we don't send any data to the internet; everything works locally.

It also features:

* Dual waveform generator (saw, super-saw)
* Pulse Generator
* Button based pulse trigger

## Included Electronics Components

We have included a bunch of electronics components which are very useful for building various analog circuits. With these components, you can build all the analog modules in the Bread Modular system (including [V2CA](/modules/v2ca), [SVF](/modules/svf), [LOW](/modules/svf) & [Drive](/modules/drive)).

Here are the included components:

* 8 rail-to-rail opamps (4 MCP6002 chips)
* 4 Vactrols
* Resistors
* Capacitors
* Diodes
* Patch Cables
* Box of Jumpers

## Tutorials

We published a [hands-on audio electronics course](https://breadmodular.notion.site) where you can build & learn audio electronics step by step. We teach from the fundamentals but without making you bored.

> These tutorials are based on a physical workshop we did in Sri Lanka & participants loved it.
