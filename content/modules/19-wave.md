This is an analog waveform generator with configurable frequency ranges.

## Functionality

* Select the frequency by connecting a column of two-pin sockets in the middle
* Define the maximum frequency it can generate by connecting a column of two-pin sockets at the bottom
* Better suited for LFOs

## Outputs
1. Square Wave Output
2. Square Wave Output
3. Triangle Wave Output
4. Triangle Wave Output
5. Sine Wave Output

## Controls

* **FREQ**: Acts as the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter
* **FINE**: Fine-tunes the above-mentioned frequency

## Additional Parts

> This section is only relevant if you are buying the semi-assembled module. You have to source & solder the following parts. You can check our guide on [common parts](/docs/technical-details/common-parts) for where to source these components.

* 2.54mm Header Pins (5-pin) - 2
* Circular Pin Header Sockets (5-pin) - 4
* 50K Potentiometers - 1 (FINE)
* 1M Potentiometers - 1 (FREQ)
