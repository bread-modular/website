This is an analog low pass gate incorporating Vactrols. It uses 2nd order RC filter as the core of the circuit.

## Functionality

* Better suited for thick bass sounds.
* Has no resonance.
* Frequency can be modulated via CV.
* A momentary **BLAST** toggle to make the CUTOFF reach the highest frequency (which sounds great.)

Here are some ways to use this module:

### 1. As a Low Pass Gate

* Use a GATE signal as the CV.
* Make sure the GATE is very short.
* Use the CUTOFF control to limit the frequency range.

### 2. As a Low Pass Filter

* Feed a fixed voltage to the CV. (Probably 3.3V from the **+V** in the input section)
* Use the CUTOFF control to set the cutoff frequency.

## Inputs

1. Audio In
2. GATE/CV In
3. +V of 3.3V (This is not an input, but can be feed for CV input to act as a low pass filter.)
4. N/C (Not Connected)
5. N/C (Not Connected)

## Outputs

1. Filter Output
2. Filter Output
3. Filter Output
4. Filter Output
5. Filter Output

## Controls

* **CUTOFF**: Controls the cutoff frequency of the filter.
* **BLAST**: A momentary toggle to make the cutoff frequency the highest possible.
