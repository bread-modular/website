This is a stereo line output module. It transforms the input signal (usually from a mixer) into a line-level output.

> This is the same Line Out available in the [BASE](/modules/base) module, but as a separate module.

## Functionality

* If the "R" channel input is not provided, the "L" channel input will be normalized to the right channel.
* Can also be used as two mono line outputs.


## Inputs

1. L Channel
2. R Channel
3. MULT
4. MULT
5. MULT
