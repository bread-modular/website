This is an analog waveform generator with configurable frequency ranges.

## Functionality

* Select the frequency by connecting a column of two-pin sockets in the middle
* Define the maximum frequency it can generate by connecting a column of two-pin sockets at the bottom
* Better suited for LFOs

## Outputs
1. Square Wave Output
2. Square Wave Output
3. Triangle Wave Output
4. Triangle Wave Output
5. Sine Wave Output

## Controls

* **FREQ**: Acts as the cutoff frequency of the low-pass filter
* **FINE**: Fine-tunes the above-mentioned frequency

## Programming

This module can be programmed via the UDPI interface. We will provide a guide on how to do it soon.
