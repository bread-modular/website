This is a quite capable analog distortion module with multiple modes. 

> You can use this as a saturator, overdrive, or as a fuzz module depending on how you use it and define those terms.

## Saturation

We use opamps and diodes to add harmonics to the waveform. Using the controls **OD1** and **OD2**, you can add distortion to the upper half or lower half of the waveform.

You can increase the control **GAIN** to increase the overall distortion.

## Overdrive

Turning both **OD1** and **OD2** to the right will turn this module into an overdrive.

## Fuzz

Output sockets labeled as **DIRTY** go through another diode-based drive circuit to add more harmonics. You can use the output socket labeled as **CLEN** to bypass this circuit.
