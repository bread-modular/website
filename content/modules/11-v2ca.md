This module has 2 instances of Vactrol Based Voltage Controlled Amplifiers (VCA).

## Functionality

* Due to the use of Vactrols, it can even smooth out square wave signals (i.e. GATEs) and can be used as CVs.
* It can only reach up to 20Hz, so it's not affected by noise in the CV signal.
* Sometimes it slightly leaks the audio even after the CV is turned off, resulting in nice analog imperfections.

## Inputs

1. Audio In for VCA 1
2. CV In for VCA 1
3. Audio In for VCA 2
4. CV In for VCA 2
5. N/C

## Outputs

1. Audio Out for VCA 1
2. Audio Out for VCA 2
3. MULT
4. MULT
5. MULT

## Controls

* **CURVE 1**: Controls the VCA1's Vactrol input voltage. Turn it to the right to make a softer VCA and to the left to make a tighter one.
* **CURVE 2**: Controls the VCA2's Vactrol input voltage.
