This module features 2 instances of Vactrol-Based Voltage Controlled Amplifiers (VCA).

## Functionality

* Due to the use of vactrols, it can smooth out square wave signals (such as GATEs) and can be used as CV.
* With a frequency response limited to 20Hz, it remains unaffected by noise in the CV signal.
* It may occasionally exhibit slight audio leakage even when the CV is turned off, resulting in pleasant analog imperfections.

## Controls

* **CURVE 1**: Adjusts VCA1's vactrol input voltage. Turning clockwise creates a softer VCA response, while counterclockwise produces a tighter response.
* **CURVE 2**: Adjusts VCA2's vactrol input voltage with the same behavior as CURVE 1.

## Additional Parts
