This module features 2 instances of Vactrol-Based Voltage Controlled Amplifiers (VCA).

## Functionality

* Due to the use of vactrols, it can smooth out square wave signals (such as GATEs) and can be used as CV.
* With a frequency response limited to 20Hz, it remains unaffected by noise in the CV signal.
* It may occasionally exhibit slight audio leakage even when the CV is turned off, resulting in pleasant analog imperfections.

## Inputs

1. Audio Input for VCA 1
2. CV Input for VCA 1
3. Audio Input for VCA 2
4. CV Input for VCA 2
5. N/C (Not Connected)

## Outputs

1. Audio Output for VCA 1
2. Audio Output for VCA 2
3. MULT
4. MULT
5. MULT

## Controls

* **CURVE 1**: Adjusts VCA1's vactrol input voltage. Turning clockwise creates a softer VCA response, while counterclockwise produces a tighter response.
* **CURVE 2**: Adjusts VCA2's vactrol input voltage with the same behavior as CURVE 1.
