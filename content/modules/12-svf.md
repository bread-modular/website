This is a traditional analog State Variable Filter (SVF) implementation that incorporates Vactrols.

## Functionality

* Ideal for creating ACID and LEAD sounds
* Features resonance control
* Simultaneously provides LOWPASS, HIGHPASS, and BANDPASS outputs
* CUTOFF frequency control via CV input
* Supports GATE signals as CV input thanks to Vactrol integration

## Inputs

1. Audio In
2. CV IN
3. MULT
4. MULT
5. MULT

## Outputs

1. LOWPASS
2. LOWPASS
3. HIGHPASS
4. HIGHPASS
5. BANDPASS

## Controls

* **RESONANCE**: Adjusts the filter's resonance level
* **FREQ**: Sets the CUTOFF frequency of the filter (CV input is limited to this maximum value)
* **FREQ CURV**: Reduces the filter's frequency range for more precise control (turn clockwise to decrease range)
