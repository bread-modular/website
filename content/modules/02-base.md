This is a minimalistic base for 12 Bread Modular modules. It features:

* USB-C based Power Supply
* Stereo Line Out
* Stereo Headphone Out

## Cascading Multiple Bases

The base is designed to be cascaded with multiple bases to create a larger setup. When you do this, you can communicate between modules across the bases as one system.

You can easily do this by connecting grounds via the 3.5mm jack sockets available on the bottom left of the base. You can use any Eurorack patch cable to do this.

## Mounting Options

The base has 4 mounting holes on the corners. You can use these to mount the base on a wooden panel or into a rack.

## Size

Once assembled with modules, the size is very similar to an Elektron Digitakt box. Therefore, you can use Elektron-compatible travel cases for transportation.
