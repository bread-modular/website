This is a minimalistic base for 12 Bread Modular modules. It features:

* USB-C based Power Supply
* Stereo Line Out
* Stereo Headphone Out

## Cascading Multiple Bases

The base is designed to be cascaded with multiple bases to create a larger setup. When you do this, you can communicate between modules across the bases as one system.

You can easily do this by connecting the grounds via the 3.5mm jack sockets available on the bottom left of the base. You can use any Eurorack patch cable to do this.

## Mounting Options

The base has 4 mounting holes on the corners. You can use these to mount the base on a wooden panel or into a rack.

## Size

Once assembled with modules, the size is very similar to that of an Elektron Digitakt box. Therefore, you can use Elektron-compatible travel cases for transportation.

## Additional Parts

> This section is only relevant if you are buying the semi-assembled module. You have to source & solder the following parts. You can check our guide on [common parts](/docs/technical-details/common-parts) for where to source these components.

[io/]

* 3.5mm Stereo Sockets - 4
* 50K Potentiometers - 2
* Pin Header Sockets (5 pin)
  * Circular - 1 (for audio inputs)
  * Square - 24 (for mounting modules)
  * Square - 2 (for 3V3/GND sockets on the bottom left)
* M3 Nuts & Spacers (optional) - 28 each
* M3 Standoffs (optional) - 28 each

We use M3 Nuts, Spacers & Standoffs to secure the modules once plugged into the board. They are not required but could improve usage, especially when doing patching.

Also, we highly recommend using some nuts or spacers on the four corners to lift the board from the surface.
