This is a MIDI Controllable Oscillator (MCO) that generates two square waves. One is the main oscillator, and the other is a detuned oscillator that can be tuned up to 12 semitones down.

Square waves are generated digitally and then mixed together using analog circuitry.

## Functionality

Here are some ideas:

* Use [SVF](/modules/svf) and [ENV](/modules/env) with a short pulse envelope to create ACID sounds.
* Use [LOW](/modules/low) with a gate input to produce solid bass sounds.
* Use [SVF](/modules/svf) and [ENV](/modules/env) with a sustained envelope for lead sounds.
* Use [Drive](/modules/drive) for more aggressive sounds.

## Inputs

[io/]

## Controls

* **DETUNE**: Controls the detune amount. Left is detuned up to 12 semitones down, and right is almost in sync.
* **MIX**: Mixes the detune oscillator with the main oscillator. Left is no mix, and right is full mix.

## MIDI

* Use any MIDI note to trigger the oscillator (this is a monophonic oscillator).
* Accept velocity and output it as a CV signal. (Velocity does not affect the oscillator.)

## Additional Parts
