This is a MIDI-controllable analog hi-hat module. You can also control the hi-hat via GATE & CV signals. 

> You need to feed noise into the module to make it work. You may use our [Noise](/modules/noise) module.


## Features

* Open & Close Hi-Hat
* Accent Control
* Full MIDI Control
* Feed Custom Noise Sources
* Get the HiHat Envelope as CV

[io/]

## Controls

* **CUTOFF**: Controls the cutoff frequency of the hi-hat. Left is higher frequency, right is lower.
* **DECAY**: Increases the decay of the hi-hat.

## MIDI

* Use any note up to (and including) Middle C (C4) to trigger the hi-hat
* Any note above Middle C will open the hi-hat
* The velocity of the note will affect the **DECAY** control


## Additional Parts

> This section is only relevant if you are buying the semi-assembled module. You have to source & solder the following parts. You can check our guide on [common parts](/docs/technical-details/common-parts) for where to source these components.

* 2.54mm Header Pins (5-pin) - 2
* Circular Pin Header Sockets (5-pin) - 2
* 50K Potentiometers - 2
* Vactrols - 2
