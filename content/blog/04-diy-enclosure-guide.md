## Material Options

You have several options for enclosure materials, each with different advantages:

### 1. Laser-Cut Acrylic

**Pros:**
- Clean, professional appearance
- Transparent options available
- Precise cutouts

**Cons:**
- Requires access to a laser cutter
- Can crack if screwed too tightly

If you have access to a laser cutter (through a local makerspace or online service), acrylic is an excellent choice. We've created some basic templates you can download from our GitHub.

### 2. 3D Printed Enclosures

**Pros:**
- Highly customizable
- Can include integrated features like cable management
- Many online services available

**Cons:**
- Print quality varies
- May require design skills

### 3. Repurposed Project Boxes

**Pros:**
- Readily available
- Pre-made and sturdy
- Often includes mounting features

**Cons:**
- Requires manual cutting/drilling
- Limited size options

## Basic Construction Techniques

Here's a simple process for creating an enclosure from project boxes:

1. **Measure your PCB** carefully, noting the positions of all connectors, controls, and mounting holes
2. **Mark the project box** for cutouts and mounting holes
3. **Drill pilot holes** for all openings
4. **Cut larger openings** using a rotary tool or appropriate cutting tools
5. **Sand edges** to smooth any rough cuts
6. **Mount the PCB** using standoffs to ensure adequate clearance

## Mounting Multiple Modules

For a cohesive system, consider these approaches:

### Rack Style

Create a simple "rack" from aluminum channels or 3D printed rails where modules can slide in.

### Unified Enclosure

Design a single enclosure with compartments for multiple modules, particularly useful if you have a specific set of modules you use together.

### Patch Bay System

Rather than enclosing each module, create a case with a patch bay where modules connect via headers or sockets.

## Tips for Professional Results

1. **Use templates** whenever possible for accurate cutouts
2. **Consider ventilation** for modules that generate heat
3. **Plan for future expansion** by leaving room for additional modules
4. **Label your enclosures** with module names and connection types
5. **Add rubber feet** to prevent sliding and protect surfaces

Remember, the beauty of Bread Modular is in its flexibility. Your enclosures can be as simple or complex as you want them to be. Share your creations on our Discord - we love to see what the community builds!
