# Introducing Bread Modular

We're excited to announce Bread Modular, an affordable modular synth platform built with the following core principles:

1. **Minimalistic Design**: We make it affordable by making things minimal rather than cutting corners on electronics.
2. **Open Source Everything**: Access to our GitHub repository with all schematics, PCB designs, and code.
3. **Modern Capabilities**: Using MIDI communication, USB-C power, and modern components.

## Why Bread Modular?

Traditional modular synthesizers are expensive, bulky, and often complicated to use. Bread Modular changes that by offering:

- Affordable modules that don't compromise on quality
- PCB-based design that reduces costs while maintaining functionality
- Open-source approach that allows for community participation
- Modern connectivity options that integrate with your existing setup
