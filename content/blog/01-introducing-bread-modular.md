We were supposed to launch Bread Modular on March 1st, 2025, but it was a Saturday and we decided to launch on Monday (2025 March 03). Interestingly enough, a couple of people have mentioned why we are not launching on March 1st.

> Honestly, we were thrilled to know that people were interested.

So, this is Bread Modular. [Have a look](/).

## Origin Story

You can learn about Bread Modular from our home page. But we'll expand on why we decided to work on Bread Modular. Our founder, Arunoda, is very keen on modular, but he soon found out that it was a very expensive hobby. Since he is based in Sri Lanka, with the shipping fees and import duty, he has to pay twice the price of the modules to bring them to Sri Lanka.

So, he decided to learn Electronics with the help of books and ChatGPT. A lot of people at AE Modular discord helped him too. Then he learned about KiCad & JLCPCB, where he could print & assemble circuit boards with SMD components.

Since he has a background in Software Engineering, he developed Bread Modular like a software project. He experimented with some designs on a breadboard, then moved them to KiCad and then sent them to JLCPCB. While waiting for the prototype, he could do the same process on some other design or validate a prototype which was delivered recently.

Due to this process, he could make a complete system from scratch in a very short time.

> So, over the last couple of months, we experimented with more than 100 prototypes.

## Affordability

The main goal behind Bread Modular is affordability. That's why we open-sourced it under the MIT license from day one. So, you can do whatever you want with the project.

We also share where you can [find parts](/docs/technical-details/common-parts) & show how to [assemble modules](/docs/getting-started/build-it-yourself).

Sometimes, you don't want to mess with assembling. So, we [sell](/modules) fully-assembled and semi-assembled modules with a sustainable profit margin.

This is our story & hope you find Bread Modular interesting.
