We [released](/blog/introducing-bread-modular) the first stable version of Bread Modular earlier this month (March 2025), and we've sold around 10 starter kits so far. While that might seem like a small number, it's more than enough for us. With a manageable number of orders, we can fulfill them quickly, identify issues early, and gradually build our supply chain and logistics.

> Even though we sell modules, we really want you to build Bread Modular from scratch. That's why we open-sourced it and show you all the steps on [how to build](/docs/getting-started/build-it-yourself) it and source the parts.

We also have a small but growing community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/W72YQKU7mq), and there are already a couple of [interesting projects](/blog/community-updates-march-2025) in progress.

## Thanks, Reddit!

A big thank you to folks at [r/modular](https://www.reddit.com/r/modular/comments/1j3zyuz/we_released_bread_modular/) and [r/synthdiy](https://www.reddit.com/r/synthdiy/comments/1j5lugy/bread_modular_10_released/) for welcoming our modular synth idea and taking a chance on an unproven technology. We’ve done our best to deliver, and so far, everyone seems happy.

## Content

Over the past few weeks, we've updated the website with essential documentation for all modules and added guides to help you get started with [patch ideas](/docs/patch-ideas/sound-check). We’re also active on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/breadmodular), sharing daily updates on what we’re working on.

We'll continue doing this, and you can expect more patch ideas from us and our community in the coming weeks and months.

## New Modules

We’ve got a solid set of essential modules, but we’re missing digital effects, kick and percussion modules, CV tools, and more. That’s what we’re focusing on now. Here’s a sneak peek at a few of them:

### Raspberry Pi-Based 16Bit Module

Our current programmable 8bit module is pretty good, and the new [supersaw](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DHnqtG8isU9/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) firmware shows its potential. However, it doesn’t have the power for high-quality reverb, delay, or better audio output. That’s why we’re working on this 16bit module. It will feature:

* 16-bit audio output (CD quality)
* Raspberry Pi Pico 2 microprocessor (Dual core 150Mhz)
* 16 MB Flash memory
* 2 MB RAM
* 4 analog/CV inputs
* MIDI support
* Various controls with buttons and knobs

We’ll develop effects and audio modules as firmwares, which you can use or extend as needed. We're aiming to launch this at under $30 initially and lower the price as we scale production.

### MIDI/CV Controls

We're building MIDI-based expansion modules for both 8bit and 16bit platforms. These will let you control parameters using additional knobs and buttons. We’re also developing a dedicated CV manipulation module that makes CV-based math easier.

### Better Mixer

Our current mixer, IMIX, is solid, but we need a larger one with send channels for effects. We're starting work on a new 4-channel mixer next week. It will be cascadeable for 8 or more channels.

> We're confident we can launch these new modules by May 1st and are looking forward to it.

## Superbooth 2025

We applied to demo at Superbooth 2025 but didn’t hear back from the team. Maybe we’re still too small. Either way, we’ll be attending, and we’re excited to meet other makers in person.

It’s been a great start—let’s turn this into a home run!
